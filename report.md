# Check: Project Report

## Executive Summary

The Check application is a simple to-do list application that provides a web application interface meant to create,
edit, and delete to-do list items. Check is built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/) and utilises [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), among other libraries. Along with standard to-do list features, Check 
encourages the registration of users, tagging of checklist items for better organisation, searching of all checklist 
items, and the exporting of a checklist to Markdown, XML, and YAML.
