The search API can be used via the search bar or by /search/:query, replacing :query with oyur query string. If the query string is contains spaces when using /search/:query replace the spaces with dashes. This search api does not do keyword search functions it will search for the whole string entered. If nothing matches your query, it will show the nav bar with nothing else. You can delete from this list and it will affect the entire list. the search API uses list.ejs to display the list of results. 
The search bar sends a GET to /search holding string q. The /search module formats q properly and then redirects to /search/:query, where :query is replaced with the properly formatted q.
